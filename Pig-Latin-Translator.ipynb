    "### Rules: \n",
    "\n",
    "#### If the word starts with a consonant and the second letter is a vowel, the first letter is thrown to the end followed by an -ay.  E.G. pelican => elican-pay\n",
    "#### If the word starts with a vowel, an -yay is added to the end. E.G. american => american-yay\n",
    "####  If the word starts with a cluster of consonants, the cluster is thrown to the end followed by an -ay. E.G. smart => art-smay\n",
    "#### but, if a -y is inside of the cluster, then the cluster is cut up to the -y and afterwards it's thrown to the end followed by an -ay. E.G. Gryffindor => Yffindor-Gray\n",
    "#### If a word is compound, it must be splitted and then apply the previous rules individually. E.G. waistcoat => aist-way oat-cay"
