# Pig-Latin-Translator

## Make sure you have all dependencies installed and setup before going into the code; the [environment.yml](environment.yml) contains an Anaconda virtual enviroment which is locked and loaded! To clone the environment with Anaconda, on terminal/command line run ```conda env create -f environment.yml``` and to activate it run ```conda activate PigLatin```

## The Jupyter Notebook [Pig Latin Translator](Pig-Latin-Translator.ipynb) contains all code structured by functions. There's a brief description of what each function does and how to use them.

## Ope-hay ou-yay enjoy-yay!
